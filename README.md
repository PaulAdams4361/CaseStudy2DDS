# **SMU Semester One, Summer 2019**
## **Frito Lay Attrition Project**

### _Purpose_
This project applies k-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes to predict attrition and Multiple 
Linear Regression to target salaries that would prevent attrition for each unique employee.

### _Prediction Methods_
1. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
2. Naive Bayes
3. Multiple Linear Regression

### _Exploratory Data Analysis Methods_
1. Random Forest
2. Heat Map with Correlation Matrix
2. Ordinary Least Squares Regression
